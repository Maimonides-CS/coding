In our last homework, we used this sentence to split a string:
String[] result = st_input.split(",|:| |\\.");

Could you read the following two links and explain how this split sentence works?
https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_regex.asp
https://www.baeldung.com/java-regexp-escape-char

Moreover, could you use the substring method provided by Java to rewrite the aforementioned split sentence and integrate your new splitter with the rest of your code in your last homework ? You can learn how to use the substring method by reading this link:
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substring.asp

Furthermore, if you use your new splitter, does your code in your last homework generate the same result? Does your new code run faster?

Hints:
1. How many for-loops do you need to use in order to rewrite the aforementioned split sentence? Could you use just one for-loop?
2. You can use this sentence, st_input.charAt(i) == ':', to see whether a char at a particular position is equal to what you want to compare.
