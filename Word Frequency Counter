This assignment is very interesting.
I copied three sentences from the New York Times.

    String st1= "Live Updates: Tornado Death Toll Rises as States Assess Damage";
    String st2 = "At least 90 people were killed by the devastating storms on Friday night, including 80 in Kentucky. The city of Edwardsville, Ill., released the names of several victims on Sunday.";
    String st3 = "The number of people reported missing at a candle factory in Mayfield, Ky., after a devastating tornado was lowered Sunday evening after company officials said that most of the employees had now been accounted for.";

If I concatenate the three strings, the result would be String input = st1 + st2 +st3 .
Could you count the frequency usage of each word in the input String? For example, in the input string, "was" appeared once and "people" appeared twice. 

Hints: 
1. You need to use Hashmap. You can find the Hashmap methods you need here:

     https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_hashmap.asp

2. There are two ways to split a string into words.
    The first way is to use the String split method and a regular     expression:  String[] result = st_input.split(",|:| ");

    The second way is to write two for-loops and use the substring method.
     You can learn how to use the substring method here:
      https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substring.asp
      
 3. Hashmap<String, Integer> hm = new Hashmap<String, Integer>();
 

You should save your results in a hashmap and print out the hashmap.
